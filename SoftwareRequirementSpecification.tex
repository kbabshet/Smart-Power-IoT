	\section{Introduction}
	
	This document details the system requirements specification for the Smart Home Power Management System. The system design document will be developed from this document.\\
	
	With the rapidly growing interest in new Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, networks consisting of these devices will become increasingly difficult to manage and control. Additionally, power consumption and monitoring will become a greater concern, especially in emerging markets such as South Africa.\\
	
	This project aims to provide a flexible software system which is able to remotely control and monitor IoT devices, as well as perform detailed power consumption diagnostics.
	
	\textbf{Choices:} 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Agile SDLC - SCRUM 
		\item Architecture - Client Server - 3 tier
		\item Front-end user interface method
	\end{itemize}
	
	%3 tier has better security because 2 tier the client is allowed access and communication with
