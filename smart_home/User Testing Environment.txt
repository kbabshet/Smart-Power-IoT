In terms of testing the front end, one of the ways to test it is to have user driven tests.
There are not many ways to autonomously test front end development besides for creating
a virtual client to run certain predefined tests. Therefore another robust method is to 
manually test various aspects of the front-end.

1/ load localhost:8000/ to see if it goes to the homepage
2/ test "home system" link to see if it goes to homepage
3/ test switches are working
4/ test link to devices directs to device list details page
5/ check that clicking on a single device takes client to detail page of the single device
6/ ensure clicking on login takes you to login page
